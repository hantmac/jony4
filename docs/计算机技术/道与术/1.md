# 代码可阅读与可维护，从 Docker principles 说起

## Docker principles
In the design and development of Docker we try to follow these principles:

(Work in progress)

* Don't try to replace every tool. Instead, be an ingredient to improve them.
* Less code is better.
* Fewer components are better. Do you really need to add one more class?
* 50 lines of straightforward, readable code is better than 10 lines of magic that nobody can understand.
* Don't do later what you can do now. "//FIXME: refactor" is not acceptable in new code.
* When hesitating between 2 options, choose the one that is easier to reverse.
* No is temporary, Yes is forever. If you're not sure about a new feature, say no. You can change your mind later.
* Containers must be portable to the greatest possible number of machines. Be suspicious of any change which makes machines less interchangeable.
* The less moving parts in a container, the better.
* Don't merge it unless you document it.
* Don't document it unless you can keep it up-to-date.
* Don't merge it unless you test it!
* Everyone's problem is slightly different. Focus on the part that is the same for everyone, and solve that.

## 代码可阅读与可维护

阅读 docker 源码过程中看到了这段编码规范，蛮好，推荐出来。

上面这些原则，基本上都是奔着“代码可阅读、可维护”去的。

然而，每个人对“可阅读、可维护”有着不同理解。

比如有的同学认为可阅读是自己可以阅读，特别是代码评审时，会用这类词语来反驳大家的看不到：“你看这段代码的意思他就是要返回一串数据库记录”。这恰恰是越狡辩越苍白无力。

**好的代码总是不言自明的。**

至于可维护，更是千人千面。有的同学喜欢拿些书上的“教条”来说事，比如要这段代码是某个编程范式要遵循某个范式、你看我这是抽象复用、你看这是“推荐的标准做法”等等。

真正好维护的代码，从来都是很现实的：你离职了别的同学能不能 1 小时或者更短时间内接手掉。

这也是我一直以来遵循的规则。别跟我讲你的代码多么多么好维护，遵循了什么什么范式。你只需要告诉我一件事：你的代码，换个刚入职的工作一年的同学，能不能维护并迭代？因为谁都不知道下一个离职的是谁下一个接手项目的是谁。

**记住“最低水平接手人”这一黄金标准。**
